            I am motivated to help people around me and my family. I grew up into a place where people were poor and the education there was not that good. I had the opportunity to come to United States to learn new skill to help the people where I grew up.
I have experience working with computers and excel. I know how to manage a computer well and I am good at typing. Also, I have some experience manage money through a computer.
